      <h3>Space Bounce</h3>
      <p>
        In an effort to strengthen my Javascript skills (and because I've always wanted
        to create a game) I developed Space Bounce, a desktop HTML5 game that
        incorporates real time physics.

        It is an object oriented Javascript
        application combining powerful JS libraries to bring it to life. The
        Flash-esque CreateJS library suite takes advantage of HTML5 and was
        used for vector graphics, animation, asset loading, audio, event
        handling, and more. The Box2DWeb library is an industrial strength physics
        engine used to handle all the physics  in the game. I
        combined the two to map graphical objects to physical bodies, creating
        a game that is both interesting to play and look at.

        Typically I work within a well structured framework such as Ruby on
        Rails, which uses the MVC architectural pattern.
        I did not do that for this project and
        by far the most difficult aspect of development was creating
        modular, decoupled code. This caused me to think hard about architecture
        in a way I haven't before.
        I'm sure there's plenty of room for improvement but I took advantage
        of established Javascript design patterns such as the
        Publish/Subscribe and Mediator pattern which greatly helped out.
