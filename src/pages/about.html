      I am a passionate tech nerd who fell down the path of web application
      development due to its rapidly evolving nature, ability to directly impact
      the everyday lives of people around the world, and neverending supply of
      cool and exciting challenges. Starting out with the ASP .NET
      framework, I eventually became swooned by Ruby on Rails for its superb
      ease and elegance of developing robust applications.

      Beyond the computer screen I am an equally great outdoor adventure nerd.
      Multiday backpacking excursions through the wild, powdering my hands with
      chalk to climb a craggy new rock, and catching fish with my teeth like
      Bear Grylls (just kidding) are just a few of the things I
      love doing outside.
