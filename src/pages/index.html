            Developed and maintained various features accross the stack
            for META>>DIRECT (a full Rails app), as well as the backend
            for BOOK>>DIRECT (Rails RESTful API). Occasionally worked on the
            AngularJS front-end for BOOK>>DIRECT as well.

            Strong desire to relocate from New Mexico. Due to an alignment of
            fortunate circumstances at the time, I decided to backpack
            Latin America to experience new cultures and adventure before
            relocating. However, I also used the free time to expand my coding
            skills and developed a cool pet project.
