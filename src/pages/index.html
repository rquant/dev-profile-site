              Developed and maintained many features accross the stack
              (primarily backend)
              for a large Rails app powering Jackrabbit's

                Meta &#155 Direct</a> product and the RESTful JSON API for
              <a href="http://www.jackrabbitsystems.com/products/lodging-search-engine/">
                Book &#155 Direct</a>. This includes extensive use of data
                modeling, automated testing, background job processing,

                  Utilized the RSpec testing library to ensure 100% code
                  coverage.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During times of demand I worked on minor features for
                  Jackrabbit's AngularJS based Book &#155 Direct front-end,
                  without prior Angular knowledge.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Worked under the AGILE Scrum practice and the JIRA tracking

                  back-end), performed code reviews, and production deploys.

              Strong desire to relocate from my homeland of New Mexico. Due to
              an alignment of favorable circumstances at the time (that may not
              exist in the future), I went on a sabattical abroad in
              Central America before making a relocation. However, I also used
              the time to expand my coding skills and
